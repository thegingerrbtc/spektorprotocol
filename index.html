    <h1>Spektor Protocol</h1>

    <section>
      <h2>Abstract</h2>
      <p>The Spektor Protocol aims to redefine self-custody in crypto, designed to protect users from avoidable risks and manipulative actors who exploit security gaps. Spektor delivers secure, self-custody access without requiring users to store recovery phrases or private keys—eliminating the vulnerabilities that have plagued the crypto space. Rather than asking users to guard seed phrases, which can be stolen or lost, Spektor leverages deterministic key derivation within the wallet itself, combining static blockchain anchor points, user-defined personal data, and a six-digit PIN to produce high-entropy keys directly in memory. These keys exist only during active use and are fully erased at the end of each session.</p>
      <p>Spektor is built for people who value security but need a practical solution that doesn’t rely on fragile workarounds. It’s a session-based model where permissions are automatically revoked when users log out, protecting privacy and ensuring sensitive data doesn’t linger.</p>

    <section>
      <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
      <h3>The Challenge</h3>
      <p>The traditional approach to wallet security relies on users storing recovery phrases, creating a host of problems. Many users—understandably uncertain about where or how to store this sensitive information—end up taking risks, saving phrases as screenshots, or writing them on scraps of paper that can be misplaced. This risk only compounds with centralized custody solutions, which demand trust in a third party for access to private keys, forfeiting control and privacy.</p>
      <p>Spektor directly addresses these issues, removing the need for seed phrases by implementing memory-only, session-based key derivation. Our approach is about real security that doesn’t rely on fragile shortcuts and keeps keys inaccessible to anyone but the user.</p>

      <h3>Spektor’s Deterministic Approach</h3>
      <p>Spektor is built on a deterministic derivation model that ensures users can reliably access their wallets, free from the pitfalls of permanent storage or seed phrase management. Our system combines blockchain anchor points, user-specific data, and a secure PIN to create a repeatable, high-entropy key derivation process, making Spektor a straightforward, reliable solution for those serious about security and control.</p>

      <h2>2. Key Derivation Logic and Entropy Generation</h2>
      <h3>Sources of Entropy</h3>
      <p>Spektor’s entropy generation combines several key, reproducible elements:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Blockchain Anchor Points:</strong> Immutable blockchain data, such as the Ethereum genesis block hash, acts as a stable, verifiable anchor.</li>
        <li><strong>User-Defined Personal Data:</strong> Users answer three personal security questions (standardized for consistency), enhancing entropy without creating new storage risks.</li>
        <li><strong>PIN-Based Anchors:</strong> A six-digit PIN further customizes entropy, selecting specific questions and blockchain anchors to enhance reproducibility and security.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Key Derivation and Session-Based Access</h3>
      <p>Spektor’s key derivation process combines these entropy sources to produce the same secure key each session. This design guarantees access without the need for persistent storage or seed phrases.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>3. Session-Based Key Handling and Auto-Revocation</h2>
      <h3>In-Memory Key Management</h3>
      <p>With Spektor, keys are generated directly in memory and accessible only during active sessions. When a user logs out, all keys are erased from memory, ensuring no traces remain. This model reduces risks by removing any need for storage and keeping sensitive data accessible only for as long as it's needed.</p>

      <h3>Automatic Permission Revocation</h3>
      <p>To further protect users, Spektor automatically revokes wallet permissions at the end of each session, eliminating potential security gaps left by lingering permissions. This is critical for users who access their wallets on shared or public devices, where lingering permissions could expose their data.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>4. Core Wallet Functions and User Experience</h2>
      <h3>Wallet Functions</h3>
      <p>Spektor offers a full range of wallet functions without compromising security:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Account Management:</strong> Users can create or access wallets using only their PIN and security questions, with keys derived for each session.</li>
        <li><strong>Transaction Processing:</strong> Users can send and receive assets with confidence, as the private key is only accessible in memory for transaction signing.</li>
        <li><strong>Token Swapping:</strong> Integrated with decentralized exchanges for flexible asset swaps, Spektor keeps users in control.</li>
        <li><strong>Staking and Contract Interactions:</strong> Spektor allows staking, DeFi actions, and governance voting, all executed with session-specific, in-memory key management.</li>
        <li><strong>Balance Monitoring:</strong> Real-time updates and balance checks are securely processed without storing sensitive information.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Privacy and Security</h3>
      <p>PIN and Security Questions: By relying on personal security questions and a six-digit PIN, Spektor offers a seamless authentication experience without relying on stored recovery phrases.</p>
      <p>Client-Side Encryption: Spektor encrypts all data before transmission, ensuring user privacy and data integrity.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>5. Security Model and Risk Mitigation</h2>
      <h3>Deterministic Key Reproducibility</h3>
      <p>Spektor’s derivation logic ensures consistent access by combining blockchain anchors, user answers, and a PIN to generate the same high-entropy key for each session. Spektor’s memory-only design eliminates the need for data storage and protects users from typical security flaws.</p>

      <h3>Memory-Only Key Management</h3>
      <p>Keys exist only in RAM during an active session, automatically clearing upon logout, which minimizes exposure. Unlike traditional wallets, where key material is often stored on disk, Spektor’s in-memory model keeps data inaccessible once the session ends.</p>

      <h3>Permission Security</h3>
      <p>Spektor auto-revokes all permissions upon session end, cutting off any unauthorized access and enforcing strict session-based security. By eliminating lingering permissions, Spektor protects users from potential exploits and unauthorized actions.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>6. Technical Implementation</h2>
      <h3>Key Derivation and Session Management</h3>
      <p>Spektor’s secure, deterministic logic produces high-entropy keys from blockchain and user-defined data. With all key management handled in memory, Spektor is free from external dependencies and data storage requirements, offering a genuinely self-contained, secure experience.</p>

      <h3>Direct Blockchain Interaction and Configurable RPC Options</h3>
      <p>Users can select their preferred RPC providers, ensuring access to decentralized networks without relying on centralized infrastructure. This customizability allows users to prioritize speed, privacy, or security as needed.</p>

      <h3>Auto-Revocation of Permissions</h3>
      <p>Permissions are automatically cleared upon session end, closing potential vulnerabilities and enforcing strong security boundaries around every session.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Spektor is for those who value true security, privacy, and control over their assets. It’s a protocol built from hard-won experience, crafted to protect users against both the mistakes we all make and the threats we don’t see coming. This is more than a wallet—it’s a stand against the failures of traditional custody solutions, and a step toward making crypto safe for everyone.</p>
